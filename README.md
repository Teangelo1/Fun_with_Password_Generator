# Password Generator vs Javascript: Who will win? *whispers* " JavaScript of course "

The goal here was to create a secure random password generator using JavaScript.
## Developer: Teangelo Burks

Creating this password generator was honestly challenging but very fun.

### Steps used in JavaScript to create this project:
* Multiple Varialbes with values assigned to use throughout our code.
* While & For loops to have specific conditions met.
* Setting up functions and Calling functions to perform specific task.
* If & Else statements to perform different actions based on different conditons.

**Criteria for a secure password:**

* Password length must be between 8 - 128 Characters.
* Password must contain at least 1 capital letter, special character, and a number.

**What exactly will the user experience look like?**
